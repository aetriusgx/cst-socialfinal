They are a pain for me to look at, I don\'t even know why they exist in the first place. Look, I\'m not trying to judge, but they\'re so fucking awful. Everytime I see the word \"amogus\" in a copypasta I just feel like I have to throw my phone into the immense void and wait for amogus to consume itself. Stop talking about the ship sussy baka imposter x the innocent kawaii crewmate in one of your useless amogus copypastas, it\'s not going to make them better. I hope that everyone that makes amogus copypastas stops already, cause they aren\'t funny at all. Everyone\'s like \"omg omg it's amogus\" and I'm here like \"omg omg it's the end to my life\",why does this have to be a thing? Why does amogus have to exist in the world of copypastas? Is that what the world is going to go through? Everytime someone wearing red kills someone else is everyone there going to say \"red's looking sussy!!1!!!1!1!1!1!!\"? Does this mean that everytime there\'s an emergency everyone is going to go \"OMG OMG EMERGENCY MEETING I VOTE RED HE\'S SUS HAHAHAHAHA DINGIDINGDINGDING\"?!? Amogus copypastas are influencing the human brain too much and I\'m here just waiting for them to stop.

The Forklift he used to bring it was still running idle at the back. I started sweating as I sat down and gazed over at the 700lb beast that was his laptop. He had already reinforced his desk with steel support beams and was in the process of finding an outlet for a power cable thicker than my thigh. I start shaking. I keep telling myself I\'m going to be alright and that there\'s nothing to worry about. He somehow finds a fucking outlet. Tears are running down my cheeks as I send my last texts to my family saying I love them. The teacher starts the lecture, and the student turns his laptop on. The colored lights on his RGB Backlit keyboard flare to life like a nuclear flash, and a deep humming fills my ears and shakes my very soul. The entire city power grid goes dark. The classroom begins to shake as the massive fans begin to spin. In mere seconds my world has gone from vibrant life, to a dark, earth shattering void where my body is getting torn apart by the 150mph gale force winds and the 500 decibel groan of the cooling fans.
